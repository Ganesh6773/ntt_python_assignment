below few assumptions are considered while solving this assignment.

1.  input data ( structured text file ) is given as input to app while starting.
2.  No need to store data in database or in file. ( though this can be easily achieved using any database of file pickling for in-file storage.)
3.  input data will not change while app is running, so not kept watch on input file changes. Thus app needs to be restarted if it data is changes.
